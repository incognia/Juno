## Getting Started

1. Fork the project on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Juno.git
   cd Juno
   ```
3. Create a branch for your contribution:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature
   ```
4. Make your changes following the guidelines below
5. Test your changes thoroughly
6. Commit your changes with proper commit messages
7. Push your changes to your repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/new-feature
   ```
8. Open a pull request on GitHub

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure your system meets these requirements:

- **Docker Engine** (24.0+) running on a modern Linux distribution
- **Docker Compose** (v2.21+) for container orchestration
- **Python 3** (3.13+) for running generator scripts
- **Node.js and npm** (for dashboard development)

### Supported Distributions

- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS / Debian 12
- Fedora 40+ / RHEL 9+ / CentOS Stream 9+

### Installation

Refer to the main [README.md](README.md) for detailed installation instructions for your distribution.

### Container Management

This project uses Docker and Docker Compose for container orchestration. All container operations are handled through Docker Compose commands and the provided management scripts.

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Generate containers configuration**:
   ```bash
   ./generator.py
   ```

2. **Build and start containers**:
   ```bash
   ./build.sh -b
   ```

3. **Start the dashboard** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   ./dashboard.sh
   ```

## Commit Guidelines

We follow conventional commit standards to maintain a clear and consistent commit history.

### Commit Format

```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Commit Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts

### Examples

```bash
# Good commits
git commit -m "feat: add dashboard auto-refresh functionality"
git commit -m "fix: resolve container port conflict issue"
git commit -m "docs: update installation instructions for Fedora"
git commit -m "chore: update Python dependencies"

# Avoid
git commit -m "ðŸš€ Add new feature"  # No emojis
git commit -m "Agregar nueva funcionalidad"  # Use English
git commit -m "WIP stuff"  # Be descriptive
```

### Changelog Updates

**Important**: When making significant changes that affect users, update the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format.

## Documentation Standards

### Language Requirements

All Markdown documentation must be written in **International English**. This ensures accessibility for the global community.

### Markdown Style Guide

For detailed Markdown formatting guidelines, please refer to our comprehensive [Markdown Standards](MARKDOWN_STANDARDS.md) document.

#### Key Requirements

- Use ATX-style headers (`#`, `##`, `###`) with spaces after `#`
- Use `-` for unordered lists, `1.` for ordered lists
- Always specify language for code blocks: ````bash`, ````python`, etc.
- Use descriptive link text and relative paths for internal links
- Include alt text for all images
- Use backticks for file names and inline code: `README.md`
- Follow consistent formatting for emphasis and structure

## Testing and Quality

### Before Submitting

1. **Test container generation**:
   ```bash
   ./generator.py
   docker compose config  # Validate generated compose.yaml
   ```

2. **Test container deployment**:
   ```bash
   ./build.sh -b
   docker ps  # Verify containers are running
   ```

3. **Test dashboard functionality** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   ./dashboard.sh
   # Access http://localhost:3000 and verify functionality
   ```

4. **Validate documentation**:
   - Check for spelling and grammar
   - Ensure all links work correctly
   - Verify code examples are accurate

### Code Quality

- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Comment complex logic appropriately
- Ensure scripts are executable and have proper shebangs
- Test scripts on supported distributions when possible

## Pull Request Process

### Before Creating a PR

1. Ensure your branch is up to date with the main branch
